# YasminPortfolio
This project was developed to provide a portfolio website for my wife, Yasmin. 
It is a simple website and minimalistic yet contains all the necessary information that showcases her skills, and past projects. It was developed
mainly using Express, NodeJS, JQuery and vanilla CSS. This my first project in which I
was involved from end-to-end, from design phase to deploy phase.

The project's code is currently in AWS.
